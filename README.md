# Papcorns Case Study
This case study provides a brief overview of the customer activity with a sample of customers from Turkey, the Netherlands, and the United States. In the first part, several tasks tapping into the general customer profile (e.g., trial conversion rate, lifetime value) are presented. In the second part, customer data is utilized to predict the churn rate and lifetime value of two customers with separate machine learning models. Text paragraphs interpreting the results are provided at the end of each task required by the template. Overall, the results show that the customers' attribution sources and country origins stand out as salient predictors of their churn likelihoods and lifetime values, in addition to calling for a richer dataset with a wider palette of customer characteristics and user activity.

Explanations pertaining to the descriptive and inferential strategies are provided in the notebook output in full detail. Click [here](papcorns_final.ipynb) to access the file.
