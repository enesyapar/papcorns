# Papcorns Case Study
This case study provides a brief overview of the customer activity with a sample of customers from Turkey, the Netherlands, and the United States. In the first part, several tasks tapping into the general customer profile (e.g., trial conversion rate, lifetime value) are presented. In the second part, customer data is utilized to predict the churn rate and lifetime value of two customers with separate machine learning models. The results call for a more extended data with a wider palette of customer characteristics and user activity.
